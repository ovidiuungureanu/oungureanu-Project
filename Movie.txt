    Project Movie

    I want to be able to access a page where i can:
- log on/create a user
- search a specific movie by Name
- see different sections of movies(sorted by genre)
- add a movie to a list/Favorite
- give a Rating/Comment
- receive a notification with the latest movies that were released
- view a chart (maybe) with the best movies sorted by rating(that the users have given)
